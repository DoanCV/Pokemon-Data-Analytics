# Pokemon-Battle-Guesser
This notebook explores Pokemon from Gen I to Gen VII, the generations I grew up with, and predicts the winner of a singles battle. <br> <br> The data from Weedle's dojo was used and I added Gen VII pokemon. Gen VII does not introduce Mega evolutions of pokemon whose base form first appeared in Gen VII.
