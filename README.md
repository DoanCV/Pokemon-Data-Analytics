# Pokemon-Battle-Guesser
This notebook explores Pokemon from Gen I to Gen VII, the generations I grew up with, and predicts the winner of a singles battle. <br> <br> The data from Weedle's dojo was used and I scrapped the Gen VII pokemon stats. Gen VII does not introduce Mega evolutions of pokemon whose base form first appeared in Gen VII. <br> <br> The purpose of this model and notebook is not to make Pokemon Showdown matches trivial given the accuracy but rather introduce players to the intuitive process behind competitve play. Similarly, the model is not as robust as one may dream for since if it were perfect, it would be cheating. Likewise, singles is not a popular format as Pokemon team combinations make every game unique and often more enjoyable. Ultimately, the model serves as a way to start team building which in my experience is the barrier of entry into this scene.
